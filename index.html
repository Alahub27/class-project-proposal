<h2>Application Overview:</h2>
<div><p3>In the application the user is going to immediately see the listed tasks they have added 
<div><p3>If it was not done, then the task would be the color red and it would show the percentage of how much the assignment was done.
<div><p3>There would also be an option for what kind of formatting the user would like, they could choose if they want it in a list style or in a calender style.

<h2>Features List: On Time</h2>
<div><p3>The features that would be included in the time I am given would be the ability to add or delete tasks. Also, the unfinished assignments would be the color red. The finished assignments 
<div>would be green and the task would be crossed out once submitted. There will be a drop down button where there is a list of categories created by the user each task belongs in.
<div>Another feature that would be included is the dates each assignment is due and how the list goes from the closest date to the farthest date the homework is due.
<div>Allow the user to add comments or notes. I will minimize the formatting of task tracker to avoid declutter nad further complications. I want to make sure ot
<div>it runs fast and smoothly for the user.

<h2>Advanced Features List: Given more time</h2>

<div>showing the tasks in a lists to showing the task in a calender.I would like to include 
<div>the percentage of how much the assignment is finished. 
<div>To give users more options of formatting, so they can change the formatting .
<div>of the list of task or color to anything they would like. I want to make it a little bit more 
<div>fun and conveniant to the user.

<h2>Basic Technical Features:</h2>
<div><p3>To have easier accessibility of the tasks and create an organizaed interface for the user.
<div>I would like to not make it less clutter and just simple, so the user would not be overwhelemed
<div>and it would just be less time consuming for the easier when accessing the information or task they need
<div>The content of the tasks would be displayed immediately as soon as the user opens it, in an organized list
<div>or whatever format the user chooses. The dates would be listed along with the assignments.

<h2>Advanced Technical Features:</h2>
<div><p3>I would like to include  tracking the duration of the users worktime when completing assignments.
<div>The percentage of how much each assinment is done and the warning the user will be notified with when
<div>the due date is nearing, but it is still not finished. I would like to include a search bar for users to 
<div>to search up a specific task they need, it would be less time consuming.
